## Week 2 Review

#### Skills Review
* Data structures
* Loops

#### Homework and labs
* Review of our first assignment
* Questions and demonstration

## Lecture and Labs

#### Example leaflet application
* In class walk-through of example application

#### Section 1: Using functions (liberally!)
* Function anatomy
  - Naming/defining functions vs calling functions
  - Providing arguments
  - The function body
  - The `return` statement
* Thinking functionally
  - Programs are data and its transformations
  - Functions are just transformations on data
  - Functions as values
* [Lab 1](lab/lab1/)


### Live coding: refactoring code into functions
* Step through the code and discuss
* Imagine alternative code flows
* Organize the code
* Make code DRYer ('don't repeat yourself')
    - Redundant code is a headache to maintain


### underscore.js

##### Section 2: [Library](http://underscorejs.org/) overview
* Selecting (filtering for) elements in lists
* `each`: No more `for` loops!<sup>\*</sup>
* [Lab 2](lab/lab2/)

<sup>\*</sup>Mostly!

## Assignment
